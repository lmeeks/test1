Network Analysis Tool
=====

This is the first attempt at github. 

This tool is a network analysis tool to identify and rank stability, topological signifiance, and redundancy for networks. The example looks at the water resources network for the Lower Bear River. The tool builds on theories of parallel coordinates with statistical analysis to quantify and compare network nodes.
